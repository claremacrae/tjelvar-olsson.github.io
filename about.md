My name is Tjelvar and I am a Swede enjoying life in Norwich.

I work as a scientific computing lab manager at the John Innes Centre, which
involves providing scientific computing services and training as well as image
analysis and software development.

I have a background in molecular modelling and biochemistry. Before joining the
John Innes Centre I was as scientist at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre where I was an agile product owner for their life-science software and
databases.

I am interested in how we can use computers and software to do better research
and to make life easier for ourselves.

I hope you find this blog useful.
